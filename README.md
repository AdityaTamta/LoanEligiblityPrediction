# LoanEligiblityPrediction
 Developed a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on factors like income, credit score, employment history, 
and existing debts, using historical loan data. 
Utilized a dataset of past loan applications to train and evaluate the model, ensuring accuracy and reliability through rigorous 
testing. 
Employed a variety of algorithms including random forest, decision trees, Na√Øve Bayes, and KNN to enhance prediction accuracy 
and robustness. Best Accuracy achieved is 82% from Naive Bayes Classifier.
